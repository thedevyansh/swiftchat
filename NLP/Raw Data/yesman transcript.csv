No.No means no.Bonjour.Carl,0
That's so weird.Had your number dialed,0
"was about to press ""send. ""Did you block your number?Yeah",0
when I don't.So,0
- You did get my text,0
- What? Text? What?We're all going out tonight.Man,0
I wish I could join you.I'm just so jammed up.I'm totally off the grid,0
you know?No,0
There's this thing I gotta do.Any other night would've been great.,0
Darn it to heck.Thing? What thing?Thing,0
I could tell you what it is......but I know there's a thing.,0
- A thing.I don't think there's anything,0
written down in your fake calendar.No,0
Specific things.,0
"Like ""get in line at the video store""?What? What are you talking about?I'm not at the video store.",0
I'm in my apartment.I can see you,0
I'm outside the video store.- That's not me.,0
- It's not?Oh,0
There is this guy who looks just like me......who goes to a lot of,0
the same stores I do.That's probably who you're seeing.Wow,0
in sync with what you're saying.Carl,0
I know you're not talking.- What? All right.,0
- Carl.- Look who's here.,0
- Hey. You.Hi.- I don't believe it.,0
- Rooney.Carl Allen.,0
Never thought I'd see the day,0
- Thought you hung up the spurs,0
keep me pretty busy.Yeah? Oh,0
for you to be here,0
to make.Honey,0
- Right?- Big step,0
- Yeah,0
- Two years.Oh,0
an engagement party on the 21 st. Open bar.Oh,0
Always knows how to get me.Nice. Carl,0
- What's there to figure out?Oh,0
What's to figure out?- Open bar. What's the problem?,0
- I'm serious. Stephanie's at the bar.- The Stephanie?,0
- Yes,0
- They seem to be thriving. Good for her.They're touching each other's genitals.,0
Isn't that amazing?I'm so glad I came out. Love it.,0
Okay,0
- What?It's been years.,0
You leave every time she comes.Totally unrelated. It has nothing,0
to do with Stephanie.Carl. Peter.- Rooney.,0
- Stephanie,0
- Hey.- I don't believe we...,0
- No,0
- Yeah,0
because you just got here.You just got here,0
and there's no time.There's a time crunch,0
and time is of the essence.Anyway,0
Oh,0
- Morning,0
for a little breakfast?Gee,0
- Yeah,0
but thanks.Good show tonight.,0
Come check us out.Your loss. Hey,0
wanna rock out tonight?- Oh,0
- Yep.- Yes?,0
- No,0
No,0
- I'm not a soldier,0
of finance.Norman. Line one.Did you wanna get that?,0
In the privacy of your office?- I'll just get it here.,0
- Yeah,0
Okay. Yep. Whatever you say.Okay.Remember that promotion,0
we were talking about?- Yeah.,0
- It's not gonna happen.Tried to fight for you on the phone there.It was between you and Demko,0
and they went with Demko.I don't care.,0
I didn't really want the job badly.I just figured after five years,0
I'd be the logical choice,0
At least you didn't get shit-canned.- Do you know what that means?,0
- Fired?How did you know what that meant?,0
Have you heard me say that before?No,0
- Well,0
I'm having a little get-together at my place.- It's a funny hat and-or wig party.,0
- Oh,0
- When is it?- Friday.,0
- I'm out of town.You spoke at the same time,0
I did just then.Like you were committed,0
to saying what you were saying......regardless of what I was gonna say.,0
- Hm.I admit,0
for a small Rollerblade shop......what with Big 5,0
and Sport Chalet......but my designs are gonna,0
revolutionize the roller industry.I know that,0
but you have no equity.- None.,0
- And your credit...Bad,0
sound desperate.- Yeah.,0
- I have no other options left.Carl. Hey. Long time no see.Nick Lane? Hey.- You don't still work at the bank,0
- Yeah.Kind of why I'm sitting outside here,0
eating my lunch,0
Didn't wanna get tied down.- How's Stephanie?,0
- Good.God.She's good. What have you been doing?I've been all over the map,0
I've lived.I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.,0
I ate bat in Laos.I shot a cow with a bazooka.I'm not proud of that last one,0
but I did it,0
"- Wanna know my secret?I'm a yes man.The word ""yes""",0
has changed my life. Here.No,0
- Yeah,0
and shatter the window?- No,0
- Then ask me if I want to.- Do you wanna throw that rock at the bank?,0
- Yes.Oh,0
- Go to the seminar,0
- Stop.Carl,0
You won't regret it.- Whoo!,0
- Hey,0
- No.Sorry.- Hello?,0
- Stephanie?- Carl.,0
- Yeah,0
I was missing you,0
- Oh,0
just snap it off already.- Pete? Hey. Where you been?,0
- You not been getting my calls?What? God,0
Oh,0
- Yeah. There it is.You know what,0
You missed my engagement party tonight.Oh,0
That was tonight?- Mm-hm.,0
- I'm so sorry,0
I promise. I swear.You pick the day. Any day you want,0
we'll go out,0
- I don't know.This wasn't drinks at a bar,0
This was my engagement party.- You only get married once.,0
- I certainly wouldn't do it again.I know,0
I know that Stephanie left you.And I know that you have issues because,0
of it,0
"You always make excuses.""I don't wanna commit.",0
"I don't wanna be tied down. ""I mean",0
my fiancee's last name?Yeah. Fisher. Fishman.- Wait. Fishwall?,0
- Fishwall?- You think her name's Lucy Fishwall?,0
- No? That's wrong?- It's Burns.,0
- Burns?It's Lucy Burns,0
She doesn't like my best friend.I keep trying to think of reasons,0
why she should,0
- Pete,0
You do whatever you want.I'm telling you,0
you're gonna end up lonely.A lonely guy,0
or does it look like he's kind of dead?Nope. No more than usual.I don't know. I'm kind of leaning towards,0
thinking he might actually be dead.I guess I never saw him a lot,0
so it's hard for me to tell the difference.Yeah,0
- Nope.Wasn't a good anything.- Are there more beers in the fridge?,0
- Sorry,0
We are about to begin.Please,0
- Hey,0
- Did you wanna...Sure,0
I knew you'd come.I saw it in your eyes,0
You're gonna love this. Terrence is a genius.He's gonna blow your mind all over,0
the room. He's like a mind grenade.- I'm not sure I want that.,0
- Yeah,0
and I mean to everything.It's starting.Life.We are all living it. Or are we?Ooh,0
but where is consciousness generated from?From the external.And how do we control the external?,0
With one word.And what is that word?- Yes!,0
- Jeez.Yes.Yes.- Yes,0
- Yes. Yes!- Yes!,0
"- Whoo!The word is ""yes. ""Yes",0
- Yes.Say it a million more times.And the word you will have said,0
"2 million times is:Yes!Yes.I want you to invite yes into your lives......because it will RSVP ""yes. ""When you say yes to things",0
you embrace the possible.You gobble up all of life's energies,0
and you excrete the waste.Before we begin today,0
I'd like to welcome our new members.- Who among you is new?,0
- He is. This guy right here. He's new.- Over here.,0
- Please don't. Jesus.- Come on up,0
- That's okay,0
Now get on up here.- No,0
- I'm sorry? What was that you said?- I said,0
- Before that.Thank you.Back up just a little bit more.- No.,0
- No man. No man.No man. No man. No man.No man. No man.Okay.If the molehill won't come to Terrence......Terrence will come to the molehill.What's your name?Carl.Let me guess,0
into coming here today,0
- Yes!And you're not sure about this,0
No man. No man.You're dead,0
and therefore you're not living.You make up excuses,0
to the people around you......and to yourself.You're stuck in the same dead-end job.,0
You have been for years.You don't have a girlfriend. You don't,0
have anything close to a girlfriend.And you lost the love of your life......because she couldn't be with someone,0
who didn't live theirs.And on most nights you're so bored,0
and filled with ennui......you can't even summon the enthusiasm,0
necessary to masturbate.Am I right,0
- Yes.- Do you want to make a covenant?,0
"- Ugh...The word is ""yes",0
- Go,0
because it doesn't really matter?Yeah,0
I can't hear myself think.It's just a little further,0
Just right up the hill there.Go ahead.And what did you say?Oh,0
over here. Okay. Yeah.What? Hello? Hello?Oh,0
- Well,0
to give me a ride. Most people just say no.Course,0
lately outside of that hotel.No problem. Have a good night.Can I borrow a couple bucks?Okay.I've come this far.Yes,0
Can I have it all?Sure. It's all yours.God bless you,0
all your money away to a homeless guy?Yes,0
burn out your phone......so you can't call AAA,0
when you run out of gas?That sounds like a fucking great idea!Why don't you take a stroll,0
through the hills......and get killed by the Manson family?,0
Don't mind if I do.Come on,0
container of gas up a giant hill to your car?Oh,0
- Maybe.Did you just run out of gas?Maybe.That sucks.,0
That happened to me last week.When you were driving,0
out of your way......to drop off a homeless guy who wore out,0
your battery so you couldn't call AAA?No. I take it,0
that's what happened to you.No. Why would you assume that?He used up your phone?Yeah. Apparently he was the most popular,0
homeless man on the planet.He was staying connected.,0
It was good to see.I'm just glad that I could,0
be a part of it,0
- Oh,0
which is cool.Well,0
be kept alive artificially.- What are you doing?,0
- I'm taking a picture. Smile.- I can't see. I'm blind.,0
- Me too. Isn't it great? Whoo!Yeah,0
- No problem.Hopefully the color will return,0
to your face sometime soon.- I'm more of a four-wheel kind of guy.,0
- Really?I never would've guessed that.,0
You seemed so at ease on two.- Can I have my helmet back now?,0
- I'm still wearing it,0
stick around and make out.- What?,0
- What did you say?Hey,0
"to something good.Never avoid opportunities.They may come in any form. ""- Hello?",0
- Carl,0
than your boss,0
on Saturday staff.Is there any way you could come in?Sure.Nothing I like better than the inside,0
of a bank on a beautiful Saturday.Yeah. Yeah,0
magical about this place.Would I like to increase the size,0
of my penis?Right.Like I need that.- Persian wifefinder.,0
- Hi there. I am Faranoush.Would you be the man for me?I guess so.Excuse me. I'd like to apply,0
for a small-business loan.And what's your business?I bake cakes in the shape,0
of different celebrities' faces.- Oh,0
- No. It's Bono.Oh. Yeah,0
like Mickey Rourke.So,0
on it,0
- Yeah.- Could that,0
- Yeah. I guess.Oh,0
Car. That could be yours.Yeah. Carl's pretty short already,0
we need around here.- Yeah.,0
- And you know what I did?What?That Demko thing really chapped my ass.,0
"I marched upstairs and I told the big guns:""Carl gets promoted in lieu of Demko",0
or along with Demko......whichever,0
walking option,0
- Good move.And they said if you started to show,0
some initiative,0
- Yeah?- Yeah,0
- Yeah.- You're making up nicknames.,0
- Okay.Know what?,0
I called Demko this morning......to ask if he could work,0
and know what he said?- No.,0
- How did you know that?He's not here.- Yeah,0

give the job to you.Norm,0

I mean,0
- I'm telling you,0
You have to say yes to everything?Yeah,0
I wasn't open to stuff,0
It's like the era of yes has begun.All right. Look,0
I'm all for it.Excuse me.,0
Could we get another round of drinks?And actually,0
will be taking care of it.- Well,0
- Yes. Yes,0
but I cannot miss this.Hey,0
into this yes thing.Argh!Okay,0
- Excuse me. Could I...Absolutely.I don't think that's what she was,0
asking for,0
think you're doing,0
It was a little misunderstanding,0
"You gotta say yes to life.I made a sacred ""conevant. ""That sounded naughty.- I think you and I need to step outside.",0
- No. God,0
to a ball......because she deserves that.Every pretty girl deserves to go to a ball.That is so nice.Oh,0
right in the face,0
- You don't have anybody's.I'm sorry,0
