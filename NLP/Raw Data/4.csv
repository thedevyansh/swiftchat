"It had already fired many employees and Ritesh has now said that won't fire anymore, I am unable to comprehend what he thinks."

"05/06/20, 12:45 - +91 78272 42432: According to me"
"Oyo will not comeback  atleast for 2yrs"
"Becoz the reason is simple and lucid that is covid 19"
"First and foremost thinks OYO must need to focus only safety ,safety and safety .let assumes that if covid 19 virus finish at the end of this year then also Oyo will have incur lots of expenses on safety of customer and that why Oyo need huge amount of fund for that ... Oyo will have to make sure that if they will be in loss they must have capacity to bear that loss ....!! Becoz time is too difficult for OYO in near future"
"Hope so OYO will comeback soon !!!😊😌"
"05/06/20, 12:45 - Deepesh Grover EE: Can u plz tell me if somehow they are able to get money how will they ensure others safety"
"05/06/20, 12:46 - Deepesh Grover EE: Yeah they can comeback atleast after 2-3 years"

"05/06/20, 12:49 - +91 78272 42432: I can guarantee you that customer will not stay in Oyo until and unless corona virus totally remove from india and globally !!!"
"And it totally depend upon vaccine...!!"
"05/06/20, 12:50 - Deepesh Grover EE: Unfortunately this isn't a solution of a problem"
"05/06/20, 12:54 - +91 78272 42432: Solution is only one.. how early coronnavirus remove from globally !!"
"Now let me know if I'm right ??"
"05/06/20, 12:55 - +91 84458 14825: Oyo have huge amount of   money reserves. So Money is not the problem of such a big startup."
"Now Ritesh Agarwal will definitely focus on quality for which it got so much of recognition."
"He will ensure the hygienic quality of products used in rooms like washing, sanitization, etc."
"05/06/20, 12:55 - Deepesh Grover EE: They need to do something . Otherwise i dont think they can comeback if they wait for the vaccine"
"05/06/20, 12:56 - Deepesh Grover EE: Bro but the real problem is air conditioner"
"05/06/20, 12:59 - +91 84458 14825: How can it be a problem?"

"Feel free to write brother 😊😌"
"We are here only for learning together !!"
"05/06/20, 13:19 - +91 70166 01800: Well, I feel that even if OYO resumes their services, people still wouldn't opt to go anywhere outside since COVID-19 cases are rising abruptly. And also, no one knows whether the rooms would be perfectly sanitised, bedsheets would be cleaned, ...etc. So, according to me there are high chances of OYO incurring losses"
"05/06/20, 13:20 - +91 78272 42432: Yeah brother"
"Totally agree with you !!!"
"05/06/20, 13:20 - Deepesh Grover EE: My opinion is that coronavirus can survive for 12 hours (average)  .  Use rooms on alternate days ."
"05/06/20, 13:21 - +91 78272 42432: Yes"
"This could be the best solution for OYO"
"05/06/20, 13:21 - Deepesh Grover EE: Sanitising after every entry will still reamin at risk"
"05/06/20, 13:21 - Deepesh Grover EE: Remain at risk and cost a lot"
"05/06/20, 13:22 - +91 78272 42432: Yep 🔥💯👍"
"05/06/20, 13:23 - +91 78272 42432: So what we conclude from overall debate ??"
"05/06/20, 13:23 - +91 78272 42432: That there is no solution currently for OYO?"
"05/06/20, 13:24 - +91 70483 03400: No doubt the hospitality sector has  been severely affected due to COVID-19 and OYO is also one of the victim's."
"Case 1 : Indian won't travel much in the upcoming months and maybe even next year, this will affect them more"
"Case 2: OYO will have an edge over other competitors because of aggressive pricing of Rooms, so the one who travel might prefer OYO over the others but here they will take into consideration Hygiene, if OYO gives assurance of safety then they have a win in this case"
"But for the same it will have to put in a huge investment in it's hotels and also to train it's employees."
"So it will take investment of time and money for OYO to get out of this."
"05/06/20, 13:24 - Deepesh Grover EE: They can still work like this"
"05/06/20, 13:24 - +91 93545 62965: Oyo can obviously make a comeback as it has developed a lot in few years"
"It was a small start-up in start but now it has been diversifed a lot"
""
"it has various branches"
"and the facility they provide is upto the mark with comparison to PRICE"
"05/06/20, 13:25 - +91 78272 42432: Yes bro 🥰💯"
"05/06/20, 13:25 - +91 93545 62965: Oyo can use alternate day method"
"and oyo can also go for proper sanitization techniques"
"05/06/20, 13:26 - +91 93545 62965: it can make a comeback only when the transportation starts"
"ie. the outer delhi person can also come to delhi"
""
"and foreign routes gets opened"
"05/06/20, 13:26 - +91 78272 42432: But you should know that OYO already incurred billions of loss !!  That is also big problem for OYO !"
"05/06/20, 13:26 - +91 93545 62965: like if transportation improves they can overcome the losses"
"05/06/20, 13:26 - +91 78272 42432: Yeah right 💯"
"05/06/20, 13:26 - +91 93545 62965: it will be a big deal"
"but its not at all impossible"
"05/06/20, 13:27 - +91 93545 62965: they can improve"
"05/06/20, 13:28 - +91 70166 01800: Agree!"
"05/06/20, 13:33 - +91 78272 42432: According to me the solution is that"
"Let suppose coustomer ready to  come in Oyo hotels and assume any of the coustomer get corona while staying in hotels , then Oyo have to make sure that they have proper remedy for coustomer to prevent the coustomer from corona !!!"
"But now you have one question i.e who will be doctor at the same time !!"
"05/06/20, 13:34 - +91 95554 18627: Sorry guys for responding late"
"First to tackle oyo's situation we can divide problems into different parts"
""
"*First Problem*"
"How to solve Covid-19 Problem"
""
"It would take more than 2-3 years to find cure of this virus or may be more so therefore  travelling could reduce but cannot be stopped so OYO can use this as an opportunity, they can provide services such as  Full room sanitzation and also can give their customers a kind of health insurance of merely  Rs 5-10 each person, this would provide assurance to people.And if they provide good sanitization services, then those mere 10 rupees would start adding to their revenue"
""
"*Second Problem*"
"How to get funds"
""
"For this they can reduce their services in other countries for some time and focus on India only, this would also reduce their costs and can help them in reset everything . Moreover they can expand again once"
"they'll be profitable."
"05/06/20, 13:34 - +91 78272 42432: No worries brother 😊😌"
"05/06/20, 13:35 - +91 70166 01800: I have a solution to it in my mind. But it's gonna cost a lot"
"05/06/20, 13:35 - +91 78272 42432: What's the Sol !!"
"05/06/20, 13:35 - +91 70166 01800: Oyo has tied up with many hotels right?"
"05/06/20, 13:35 - +91 78272 42432: Brother 😊 better solution 😍"
"05/06/20, 13:35 - +91 78272 42432: Yeah !"
"05/06/20, 13:36 - +91 70166 01800: Ever heard of Hub and Spoke model?"
"05/06/20, 13:36 - +91 70166 01800: Here I'll be making some changes to that model"
"05/06/20, 13:36 - +91 78272 42432: Nope 😁 brother"
"05/06/20, 13:37 - +91 70166 01800: Okay. No issues"

"05/06/20, 13:38 - +91 70483 03400: Something like a Central Hub and other branches as spoke?"
"05/06/20, 13:38 - +91 70166 01800: So, we'll be analysing the neighbourhood of a hospital at first"
"05/06/20, 13:38 - +91 70166 01800: Yes"

"05/06/20, 13:40 - +91 70166 01800: A Hospital should be made a central hub. If possible, OYO could tie up with hotels and lodges nearby that hospital (or even make one)"

"07/06/20, 12:50 - +91 78272 42432: Never sell the company , the reason behind it is too clear that air india have lots of assets"

We will not be having a huge profit but as the company is undergoing losses ,it will overcome that and once it comes back on track , we will get back to the earlier ( if required)"

"07/06/20, 13:33 - +91 87555 66115: Allowances reduction of workers is not a good choice. An unhappy employee will never yield good results for the company , more specifically when he has been offered some allowances and now he is denied to get them."
""
"Secondly Air India was already very much in demand so it was a rare scene to see empty seats thus reducing price of seats won't help."
""
"Yes it is true that government may be one of the factors for the failure of the company but it can't be blamed wholly for the loss."
""
"Moreover the discussion is about Air India and not the government so we should better stick to the point."
""
"According to the case, the company is at a critical point of disaster so it needs an external agent to extend some help. I being the CEO may have connections with some buyer firms thus I need to make a supremacy of the current working of the company and the back loaded debts the company is facing which is affecting the present healthy working of the organization. Thus making a contract that I am ready to sell Air India  to a some other private firm only on the condition that the regulating board of council including me as the CEO should remain the same for the future working of the same except for the situation that now it can be handled or accessed by the firm which has bought it. Since the present working would be known as supreme among other airlines thus the buying firm won't disagree for the fact of not changing the active council . By this method , almost all the staff gets to keep their jobs and the debts are now the responsibility of the buying firm which is expecting the present Air India council to give profits which will equalize the debts which the firm has paid."
"Only difference in this condition would be that previously I was the owner of Air India and now I am an employee in the buyer firm acting as the head of this airlines council."
""
"The method in some sense may look unethical but according  to me, it would be the best solution at present to save the company."

We have many like wix, woocommerce or shopify. I can take professional pictures for the same and can make amazing website at very low price. Plus social media advertising is the key to success now.

"While sitting at home, you must be getting a lot of business ideas. So, why dont you share a small *elevator pitch* of any product/service you must be thinking of or you can choose any existing industries as well."
""
"For instance: A hotel industry has different lines of hotels like budget hotels - oyo, treebo, fab hotels etc.. then we have mediocre hotels like Ibis, lemon tree, etc and lastly we have high end luxury hotels like Taj, hyatt, oberois etc."
""
"Imagine yourself as a sales person in one of these hotels and you get to meet the client in a lift but you do not get enough time to explain everything , so prepare an elevator (lift) pitch which is *usually less than a minute in which you have to brief the USPs and the description of the product.*"
""
"It will be better if we can do it on Audio/voice notes  so everybody will get to know what tone and pointers are used in the pitch."
""
"Inclusions can be pharma, hospitality, banking(financial consulting included), fashion, sports, any industry/product of your choice."

"*Looking forward to your unparalleled pitches!*"

"Right now ,it will be suitable if we build a better Indian funding and investment environment in the backdrop with Chinese funding to continue at some minimum level...once we can sustain, we can stop the Chinese funding and focus on regional one"
"22/06/20, 19:04 - +91 91402 96568: According to me , we should not boycott China immediately, ""boycott China"" is only a term which is nowdays trending in social media but in reality we cannot boycott China as our economy and market is very much dependent on China and it will create a huge problem  so we first consider developing products /services like China and once they start growing we should slowly stop using product/services of China this will not affect the economy and market on a huge scale. In this way we will be able to actually boycott Chinese products/ services without a damage."

"1:-This is because now I am not a employees who do particular work , now I am at higher position now my duty is to delegate work to employees and give them intiative to take action !!!"
"2:- I will try to make my employees intrapreneur not employees 😉 it helps them to share his/her ideas with their boss because now they have authority and responsibility !!!"
"3 :- now I have responsibility of leadership which is good for me , and learders never escape from their responsibility 😊!!"
"I will train employees and listen their feedback, queries and try to solve them which will be beneficial for me as well for my employees ,becoz my image towards employees good and these lead to increase in the morale of employees"
"4:- I will have opportunity of making my small company into big company may be this will lead to my promotion like ceo , CFO , co founder ...ect"
"6 :- I will have opportunity to upgrade my skill by hiring new talents and Learn from their new ideas and skill which I don't have"
"There are many benefits of working in small company at higher position!!!"
"27/06/20, 13:25 - +91 78272 42432: 5 :- I have not written yet 5 benefit"
"Fifth benefit for me is to create more leaders in small company which help me in future for make my company into next level !!"
"This will also lead to create more jobs , when more jobs higher the level of employment that's good for economy 😊"
"27/06/20, 14:36 - +91 98219 06708: This is understandable, as the name is already big, but don't you think , there will be less opportunities for you, where your ideas will be heard in company's building"
"27/06/20, 14:38 - +91 98219 06708: Great description!!! I agree with this too. Small companies have great scope for adding of new products, services, increasing their reach."
"27/06/20, 14:41 - +91 78272 42432: Yes didi 😌"
"27/06/20, 14:41 - +91 78272 42432: Exactly 🙂"
"27/06/20, 14:44 - +91 78272 42432: I honestly believe on this statement too didi 😊"
"But according to my view point of view less chance of upgradation but it is also true that chances come when you try to do unique !!!"
"27/06/20, 14:46 - +91 78387 34985: I would work in small company at high position because I believe in taking a small company to great heights with my potential then to uplift an already uplifted company"
"27/06/20, 14:49 - +91 78272 42432: Yes didi there will be more chances of adding product because already company made their big brand ,this is benefit of company to add more product , customer have faith that's why the company is big !!!"
""
"Sorry didi 😬 for bit wrong point of view!!"
"27/06/20, 15:02 - +91 97325 16008: So the dilemma here is wheather it's better to join a small company as a decision maker with a bit of autonomy or as a facilitator in a big company."
""
"So neglecting all the possibility of failure let's think of the most optimistic possibilities."
"For the the big company, you will start with no experience of the corporate world . You have to learn and fight the throat cutting race in an invincible way and after working hard for years you may get promoted to a CxO position along with a white haired head with no life left. In this way you will end up as one of the highest paid employee in the corporate world. As simple as that."
""
"Now  let's see what happen if you go with the small one."
"You will start as an executive. Your decision will be very crucial for making this company grow. You have to lead a heard of employee and make them the work done. You will get a lot of chance to meet a lot of influential people from the industry. Some of them will be your friends. And few of those friends will be successful ones. And thus you get leadership skill, knowledge about the industry and some influential and successful contacts. And all this at an age from where you can start again afresh . It's the perfect situation from where you can take the risk and pitch your own idea and bang!  Be the next  billionaire !"
""
"So for dreamers the small one and for comfort seekers the big one."

"29/06/20, 22:09 - +91 98219 06708: Having cheaper alternatives likes Samsung, which has different range of prices in their smartphones as it can target larger audience is definitely a threat to them"
"29/06/20, 22:10 - Hardik Sharma: Well that's a question"

"29/06/20, 22:37 - +91 78272 42432: Sorry for the late response"
"Pros"
"1 :- Apple phone is prefect for buisnesaman coz it's give extreme better security compare to other phone"
"2 :- apple has its own iOS that's why also people believe it's save our data"

"29/06/20, 22:40 - +91 97325 16008: I think price in Indian market should be at least at per with the global market. It's currently about 25-30% dearer than the converted price of US market as per the current exchange rate.  As per the current brand prestige of apple, nothing seems as a major bad bit except that price point."
"29/06/20, 22:54 - +91 99535 14453: 25-30 Dearer?  Means?"
"29/06/20, 22:54 - +91 99535 14453: I guess that's the same case with samsung too agree??"
"29/06/20, 22:55 - +91 94165 57880: Security mam Security"

"30/06/20, 18:24 - +91 98111 50026: There is a lot of controversy about it being overrated and androids being better, that is a though which might be in the back of their mind"
"30/06/20, 18:24 - +91 98219 06708: Maybe, but I heard more about iPhone"

"30/06/20, 18:27 - +91 98219 06708: True that. Some people like me, often face problem while connecting it to our laptops and PCs"
"30/06/20, 18:27 - +91 98111 50026: They haven’t done any major technological advancements recently but they have significantly increased prices"

"30/06/20, 18:28 - +212 629-299301: Yes I can relate too 😆"
"Android is much easier"
"30/06/20, 18:30 - +91 80051 88360: There can be various reasons:-"
"1. One such can be it's high price because of which many people can't afford it."
"2. They have a iOS which is different from Android so people will find it difficult to switch from Android to iOS."
"3. iOS phones can't be connected to any laptop easily so again a minus point."
"4. People can have most of its feature in an Android phone and also some good processor phones in price lower than an iPhone."
"30/06/20, 18:31 - +91 98111 50026: The most debatable thing is that android security is pretty questionable and the uplifting status that comes with apple devices has prevailed for long enough"
"30/06/20, 18:31 - +91 98219 06708: Some of our group members pointed out the fact that iPhone is more secure than android phones"
"30/06/20, 18:32 - +91 98219 06708: What are your views on it?"
"30/06/20, 18:34 - +91 80051 88360: In this era of cyber attack we can not say anything is secure there are various vulnerabilities even in an iPhone and you must have heard about Jeff Bezos phone was hacked and almost 6GB data from his phone was theft . Actually security is just a myth ."
"30/06/20, 18:35 - +91 80051 88360: And he was using an iPhone"
"30/06/20, 18:35 - +91 80051 88360: at that time"
"30/06/20, 18:35 - +91 98111 50026: But would you say that android is more secure than an iPhone, generally?"
"30/06/20, 18:36 - +91 80051 88360: It is all about who are after you if a hacker want to exploit your detail use any phone it can be exploited ."
"30/06/20, 18:37 - +91 98111 50026: Then do you want us to switch to pen and paper as means of storing data?"
"30/06/20, 18:37 - +91 72909 08646 left"
"30/06/20, 18:37 - +91 98111 50026: We have to use something right? So better be a more secure than a less secure"
"30/06/20, 18:37 - +91 98111 50026: That’s where apple plays it card"
"30/06/20, 18:38 - +212 629-299301: But I have read that hackers mostly target Android phones than IPhone because it's easy to be hacked"
"So this makes Android less secure than IPhone"
"30/06/20, 18:39 - +91 80051 88360: Ok tell me about what kind of security is being provided by iPhone over android phone"
"30/06/20, 18:43 - +91 80051 88360: Ok even if iPhone provide better security how many people can afford it ? If one can't be able to afford it then as you have said one must use something in place of using nothing . So one will always use Android ."
"30/06/20, 18:44 - +91 98111 50026: They dont have to go for the latest version"
"30/06/20, 18:44 - +91 98111 50026: They can buy a previous version iphone too"
"30/06/20, 18:45 - +91 80051 88360: If you are in 2020 and want to live in 2015 you can go for it as it will not have much features as other Android phones are having."
"30/06/20, 18:46 - +91 98111 50026: I’m using an iphone 8plus which i bought in 2019"

"30/06/20, 18:46 - +91 98111 50026: I’ve all kind of features available"
"30/06/20, 18:46 - +91 98111 50026: Are you saying you buy a phone every year to stay in that certain year?"
"30/06/20, 18:47 - +212 629-299301: Like iCloud  option and also IPhone can't be connected with Android devices like for example via  the Bluetooth"
"30/06/20, 18:47 - +91 80051 88360: It is still 40k phone dear again affordability problem"
"30/06/20, 18:47 - +91 98218 07152: When Samsung, oppo, vivo, etc etc are providing us almost the same camera quality, or basically the features which a common man use starting from 6-7k , why would a person buy a phone of 70k"
"30/06/20, 18:47 - +91 84479 18046 left"
"30/06/20, 18:48 - +91 98111 50026: That is because I wanted that one"
"You can go for iphone 7, SE or XR"
"30/06/20, 18:48 - +91 98111 50026: Cheaper ones"
"30/06/20, 18:48 - +91 80051 88360: That is my point why we will expend a lot more than that"
"30/06/20, 18:49 - +91 98111 50026: Oh my god don’t ever say that the camera quality is same take a picture from iPhone’s 8 megapixel and vivo or oppos 20 megapixel, you would still see the better one on iphone"
"30/06/20, 18:49 - +212 629-299301: Guys one thing to remember is that IPhone have a very *big high reputation in the market*"
"So psychologically people think they have the best product ever in the market and they simply buy it"
"30/06/20, 18:49 - +91 98111 50026: Everyone would go for what they can afford basically"
"30/06/20, 18:50 - +91 98111 50026: The only phones giving competitive prices and quality are Samsung 35k+ versions and one plus phones."
"30/06/20, 18:51 - +91 80051 88360: While purchasing a phone one person does not keep one thing in mind"
"30/06/20, 18:51 - +91 80051 88360: They look for many features"
"30/06/20, 18:52 - +91 80051 88360: Like good camera,processor,latest features available, Ram,Rom etc"
"30/06/20, 18:52 - +91 80051 88360: So if you think people will buy iPhone only because of its security and reputation then it is not the case"
"30/06/20, 18:53 - +91 80051 88360: Even Bill Gates uses Samsung phone"
"30/06/20, 18:53 - +91 80051 88360: Mark Zuckerberg also don't use iPhone"

"05/07/20, 13:28 - Hardik Sharma: The following points, according to me are helpful in building a brand:"
""
"Building a brand is like making a food item, you must know your audience well-their choices, interests, and what fuels them to share the experience which they have with your brand. Experience today, again is as important as the kind of product we have to offer-building a great experience from our brand may make our customers loyal and even if we face a competition, they will be initially reluctant to switch. In creating experience, technical fields like UX/UI as well as the kind of advertising we adopt matter; giving referral awards to consumers and strategies that reflect our USP go a long way in powerful brand connect"

"Never underestimate your Clients' Complaint, no matter how funny it might"

""
"This is a real story that happened between the customer of General Motors"
"and its Customer-Care Executive. Please read on."
""
"A complaint was received by the Pontiac Division of General Motors:"
""
"'This is the second time I have written to you, and I don't blame you for not answering me, because I sounded crazy, but it is a fact that we have a tradition in our family of Ice-Cream for dessert after dinner each night,"
"but the kind of ice cream varies so, every night, after we've eaten, the whole family votes on which kind of ice cream we should have and I drive down to the store to get it. It's also a fact that I recently purchased a new Pontiac and since then my trips to the store have created a"
"problem."
""
"You see, every time I buy a vanilla ice-cream, when I start back from the store my car won't start. If I get any other kind of ice cream, the car starts just fine. I want you to know I'm serious about this question, no"
"matter how silly it sounds ""What is there about a Pontiac that makes it not start when I get vanilla ice cream, and easy to start whenever I get any"
"other kind?"" The Pontiac President was understandably skeptical about the letter, but sent an Engineer to check it out anyway."
""
"The latter was surprised to be greeted by a successful, obviously well educated man in a fine neighborhood. He had arranged to meet the man just"
"after dinner time, so the two hopped into the car and drove to the ice cream store. It was vanilla ice cream that night and, sure enough, after they came back to the car, it wouldn't start."
""
"The Engineer returned for three more nights. The first night, they got chocolate. The car started. The second night, he got strawberry. The car started. The third night he ordered vanilla. The car failed to start."
""
"Now the engineer, being a logical man, refused to believe that this man's car was allergic to vanilla ice cream. He arranged, therefore, to continue"
"his visits for as long as it took to solve the problem. And toward this end he began to take notes: He jotted down all sorts of data: time of day, type of gas uses, time to drive back and forth etc."
""
"In a short time, he had a clue: the man took less time to buy vanilla than any other flavor. Why? The answer was in the layout of the store. Vanilla,"
"being the most popular flavor, was in a separate case at the front of the store for quick pickup. All the other flavors were kept in the back of the store at a different counter where it took considerably longer to check out"
"the flavor."
""
"Now, the question for the Engineer was why the car wouldn't start when it took less time. E..ureka - Time was now the problem - not the vanilla ice"
"cream!!!! The engineer quickly came up with the answer: ""vapor lock""."
""
"It was happening every night; but the extra time taken to get the other flavors allowed the engine to cool down sufficiently to start. When the man got vanilla, the engine was still too hot for the vapor lock to dissipate."
""
""
""
"Even crazy looking problems are sometimes real and all problems seem to be simple only when we find the solution, with cool thinking."
""
"Don't just say it is "" IMPOSSIBLE"" without putting a sincere effort."
"What really matters is your attitude and your perception."
""
"Moral of the Story: ""Try to Fix the Bug instead of making it as a known issue."""

"But I have no idea about greenwashing"
"11/07/20, 16:57 - +91 95990 58664: Greenwashing is the process of conveying a false impression or providing misleading information about how a company's products are more environmentally sound. Greenwashing is considered an unsubstantiated claim to deceive consumers into believing that a company's products are environmentally friendly."

"04/08/20, 12:01 - +91 79053 63306: The case discusses the dispute between US-based global fast food chain McDonald’s and one of its Indian joint venture partners, Connaught Plaza Restaurants (CPRL) led by Vikram Bakshi (Bakshi), which affected the fortunes of the fast food chain in the highly competitive Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) market in India. McDonald’s, which entered the country in 1996, operated through two master franchisees, one a 50-50 joint venture with Bakshi called CPRL covering the northern and eastern parts of the country, and another with Hardcastle Restaurants Pvt. Ltd (HRPL) owned by Amit Jatia, covering the southern and western parts. In 2008, after more than 15 years of smooth operations during which McDonald’s acquired a pan-India presence and became synonymous with fast food in the country, the partnership between Bakshi and McDonald’s turned sour after McDonald’s tried to buy out Bakshi’s 50% stake. McDonald’s contended that CPRL was not maintaining the required quality and had failed to pay royalties for two years. In 2013, Bakshi was ousted as the MD of CPRL, but he was reinstated in 2017 after the case was referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The tribunal also barred McDonald’s from interfering in CPRL’s operations. On August 21, 2017, McDonald’s terminated the franchise agreement with CPRL for 169 restaurants operating across northern and eastern India. Bakshi, however, continued to run his outlets as he had earlier. As the impasse continued, competitors started gaining ground in the lucrative Indian QSR market. McDonald’s posted a loss of Rs. 3.05 billion in the financial year ended December 2017. Moreover, the mass closure of the restaurants disappointed customers and affected the brand image of McDonald’s in the country. Going forward, analysts feared that McDonald’s could lose a long-term growth opportunity in India’s rapidly growing QSR market if it did not sort out its problems soon."
