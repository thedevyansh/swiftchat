Hello! Do you like rock music?,agent_1,Happy,FS3,Good,
Hi! I love rock music and it has been for a while now. I think since the 60s.,agent_2,Happy,FS3,Excellent,
"Yeah, it's definitely a classic and great genre. White snake has had over 50 members through it's history. That's crazy!",agent_1,Happy,FS3,Good,
I know. The list has its own wikipedia page.,agent_2,Neutral,FS3,Excellent,
"I wonder why so many people ended up leaving/joining the band. Do you know if they were just a specific position switching out, like a guitarist?  ",agent_1,Curious to dive deeper,FS3,Good,
"I guess they may not have get used to that life style. Did you know that a song became popular because a DJ didn't reveal the band name. Don't remember where it was, but still incredible. ",agent_2,Surprised,FS3,Poor,
That's pretty interesting. Sonic the hedgehog was supposed to have been in a rock band. I wonder how that would have worked out. ,agent_1,Happy,FS3,Good,
"Hahaha. Honestly, I have no idea. I also heard that he have a blond haired human girlfriend named Madonna.",agent_2,Happy,FS3,Excellent,
That's really strange. I'm glad he just stayed a video game character. Viktor tsoi kept his job in a boiler room after becoming the biggest rock star in russian history. ,agent_1,Happy,FS3,Good,
"russian already sounds like rock anyways. Rock is kind of interesting, even Oklahoma has a state rock song.",agent_2,Surprised,FS3,Poor,
That's pretty cool. Did you know the man who assassinated Abraham Lincoln was named after the man who assassinated Julius Caesar? ,agent_1,Happy,FS1,Good,
too much concidence. Abraham Lincoln has a unusual voice. Do you know how he sounded?,agent_2,Surprised,FS1,Excellent,
"Apparently he had a high pitch voice, I never would have guessed that! I always imagined him as having a deep voice for some reason.",agent_1,Happy,FS1,Good,
Me too. The say that he used to keep his important documents in his hat. That's kind of funny. Now we know why the hat was so high. hahaha,agent_2,Happy,FS1,Excellent,
"He had so many secrets in there, lol! Lincoln created the secret service the morning he was shot. That seems suspicious. ",agent_1,Happy,FS1,Good,
I think so too.  Abraham Lincoln was the first republican as well.,agent_2,Surprised,FS1,Good,
That's interesting! He started a long line of bearded republicans! ,agent_1,Happy,FS1,Good,
he had done good things as well. He preserved the Union and abolished  slavery.,agent_2,Happy,FS1,Good,
"Yeah, he was very noble and good hearted. He was also a lawyer before becoming a politician! ",agent_1,Happy,FS1,Good,
I wonder if he was a good lawyer.  I heard he also modernized the economy.,agent_2,Neutral,FS1,Not Good,
"Yes,he was a  very good president! Well, it was nice chatting with you! ",agent_1,Happy,FS1,Excellent,Personal Knowledge
