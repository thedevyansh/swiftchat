Did you know that the University of Iowa's locker room is painted pink? I wonder why?,agent_1,Curious to dive deeper,FS1,Good,
I think I did hear something about that.  I imagine it is an attempt to psych the other team out.,agent_2,Neutral,FS1,Good,
"So, it would be in the visiting team's locker room but not their own?",agent_1,Curious to dive deeper,FS1,Good,
Right.  Teams do all kinds of things to bother the competition. I've heard of teams having heated benches in the winter for themselves but not for the visitors.,agent_2,Neutral,FS1,Good,
"I would hate a cold bench. Then again, I wouldn't want to be some place that cold or watching football.",agent_1,Neutral,Personal Knowledge,Good,
I'd rather watch it inside where it's warm.  Have you heard about the Georgia Tech-Cumberland game of 1916?,agent_2,Neutral,FS1,Good,
"No, what happened in that game?",agent_1,Curious to dive deeper,Personal Knowledge,Good,
"Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland but here's the thing, they defeated them by a score of 222-0!",agent_2,Neutral,FS1,Good,
That is insane. How could that even happen?,agent_1,Surprised,Personal Knowledge,Good,
I don't know but it did.  It's the highest scoring game in history.,agent_2,Neutral,FS1,Good,
I'm sure. I don't even watch much and I couldn't imagine that score. I wonder if most people left or were they curious to see how high it would go?,agent_1,Curious to dive deeper,Personal Knowledge,Good,
"I guess it depended on what team you were pulling for.  To me, it's surprising that the highest scoring game was in college football and not professional.",agent_2,Neutral,FS1,Good,
Maybe it is because some are not as good in college so they may be playing against someone not on their level.,agent_1,Neutral,Personal Knowledge,Good,
Good point.  Professional does have a player that has never fumbled the ball.,agent_2,Neutral,FS1,Good,
I've heard that. Wasn't it a Patriot player?,agent_1,Curious to dive deeper,FS1,Good,
It was. It was a running back by the name of Benjarvus Green Ellis.,agent_2,Neutral,FS1,Good,
That is an interesting name. It's like he has a lot of names.,agent_1,Neutral,FS1,Good,
i guess so.  Do you watch espn?,agent_2,Neutral,FS1,Good,
No. I don't have regular cable. I use a ROKU and I think you would have to pay extra for ESPN. I didn't watch it when I did have cable though.,agent_1,Neutral,Personal Knowledge,Good,
"Oh, I was going to tell you about them winning an emmy but that's okay.  Well, do you watch or have you watched pokemon?",agent_2,Neutral,FS1,Good,FS2
"No, I haven't watch pokemon. My sons use to play with the when they were little. Now they use their phones looking for pokemon in the neighborhood. It is funny.",agent_1,Neutral,Personal Knowledge,Good,
"That is funny.  Pokemon is pretty popular and has been for a while now  They have over 750 tv episodes alone.  Well, I have to go now.  It's been nice chatting with you!  Have a great day!",agent_2,Neutral,FS2,Good,
