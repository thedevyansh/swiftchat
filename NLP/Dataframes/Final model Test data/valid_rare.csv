"Yes. she wrote hundreds and hundreds of poems, but they were locked away in a drawer, and a critic said that there were many arresting phrases, nothing scanned or rhymed properly, and so he declined to help get them published. ",agent_2,Neutral,AS2,,Excellent,
Did you kow theres a poem when read normally is depressing but when read backward is uplifting? ,agent_1,Curious to dive deeper,FS2,Personal Knowledge,Passable,
"Wow! That is certainly different than Emily's poetry.  There's such a diversity in poetry. It's no surprise, since poetry dates back to prehistorical times. Did you know some of the first poetry was hunting poetry in Africa?",agent_2,Curious to dive deeper,FS1,,Excellent,
"Yes and and extensively throughout the history of the empire of the Nile, Niger and Volta river valleys. ",agent_1,Curious to dive deeper,FS1,Personal Knowledge,Passable,

"Funny! You really can do so much with poetry! There's also a poem that's 274 lines, and features about 800 irregularly pronounced English words. It's called The Chaos. I'd like hear that one read out loud!",agent_2,Surprised,FS1,,Excellent,
Yeah that seems like the right name for it. Do you listen to or play the piano? ,agent_1,Curious to dive deeper,FS2,Personal Knowledge,Passable,

"That's all i do is bang on them while missing the keys i'm aiming for, lol! Nice chatting with you. ",agent_1,Curious to dive deeper,FS3,Personal Knowledge,Passable,
