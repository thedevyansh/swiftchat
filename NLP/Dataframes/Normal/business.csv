the  ticking budget  facing the us the budget proposals laid out by the administration of us president george w bush are highly controversial,,,,,,,,,,,,,, the dollar is already sinking, before too long  credit markets are likely to react  and interest rates will creep upwards, that will be the shock,  interest-sensitive industries will feel pain immediately - sectors such as housing  automobiles  other consumer durables  agriculture  and small business, some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the us capitol in the late 1970s, there will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget, the public outcry will force congress to act, whether it will act wisely is another matter, how did this happen   by definition  the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn t adequately capture the current situation, federal revenues are at 1950s levels  while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher, in addition  the united states has two significant military missions, the bush administration s chosen remedy is the least feasible one, reducing domestic spending  or eliminating  waste  fraud and abuse  is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem, indeed  if congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way  there would hardly be any such spending left, law enforcement  space exploration  environmental clean-up  economic development  the small business administration  housing  veterans  benefits  aid to state and local governments would all but disappear, it s fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed, the biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security)  and health care for the elderly and the poor, to some extent  increases in these areas are inevitable, the us population is aging  and the nation does face genuine threats in the world, but serious savings can only be found where the big money is, savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system  public and private, brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation s elderly and indigent,  on the revenue side  the lion s share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since 2000 will have to be replaced,  some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes, finally  blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned, there is no good reason to fixate on it  anyway, moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely, borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense, the sooner we face that reality  the sooner workable reforms can be pursued, first on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue  simplify the tax code  and restore some fairness eroded by the bush tax cuts, second should be a dispassionate re-evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years  much of it unrelated to afghanistan  iraq  or terrorism, third must be the start of a serious debate on large-scale health care reform, one thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the us economy and government for the challenges of this new century,,,,,

making your office work for you our mission to brighten up your working lives continues - and this time  we re taking a long hard look at your offices,,,,,,,,,,,,,, it is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy - with the danger that when the workload eases  they have to be resurrected,    prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water-and-weather-tight  and the structure is checked for stability, it appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing,  ideally  the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn, this would also allow for a well-insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured, it is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity, in order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating  power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate, ideally  it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities, the walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed  and the walls should be painted in a light colour, the owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks; this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface, i would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn, as for lighting  consider a combination of floor mounted uplights  wall lights (wall washers) and selected downlights, use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior,    please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for marianne s barn,  the layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space, large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available, the finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting  while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace,    regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house  your plan of going wireless is sensible, a wireless router/access point in the house with a wireless lan card in the pc in the renovated area may be sufficient, however  important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass  which could result in a weak signal strength, you may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area, your local it supplier will be able to advise on this, if you haven t already invested in robust firewall and anti-virus software  it is essential to do so  to protect your investment, to really take advantage of wireless technology  you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor, or you could use one of the new tablet computers  which allow you to write directly on the screen and convert into text with built-in hand recognition software, and finally  you will save money and space by considering a multi-function product for print  scan  copy and fax,,,,,,,,,,,,

giving financial gifts to children your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this christmas  but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future   gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  if the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance, as long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance  then no tax will be payable, when the account is opened a form  r85   available from the bank or building society  should be completed, this confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax,  the tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child, only ¬£100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free, where interest exceeds this level  the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent, this is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children s names and taking advantage of the tax allowances, where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child  consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents  gifts and one for gifts from other relatives, therefore  it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the child trust fund which is tax free  with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual ¬£1 200 limit being directed to a deposit account,  another favourite solution is premium bonds, with the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account  they make great presents, the parent or guardian will be responsible for the bonds and will receive notification of the purchase, any prizes will be sent to the parent or child s guardian, the minimum for each purchase is ¬£100 and bonds are sold in multiples of ¬£10,  there are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored,  over the longer term  stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment  although in the shorter term they can be volatile, one of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares, one way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust, these are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares, these funds may be actively managed  where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential  or passive  where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index  for example  the ftse 100, exchange traded funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market, these are single shares that give the return of an underlying index (so are really another form of tracker), the difference is that the charges are quite low, the only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18  and parents will have no control over how it is spent, for larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income,,,,,,,,,,,,

yukos unit fetches $9bn at auction a little-known russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant yukos at auction in moscow,,,,,,,,,,,,,, there were originally four registered bidders  and with its close ties to the kremlin  state-backed gas monopoly gazprom had been seen as favourite, but just two companies turned up for the auction  gazprom and the unknown baikal finance group  named after a large freshwater lake in siberia, and  according to tass news agency  gazprom did not make a single bid  leaving the way open for baikal  which paid above the auction start price of 246,75bn roubles,  mystery firm baikal finance group is officially registered in the central russian region of tver  but many analysts believe it may be linked to gazprom, kaha kiknavelidze  analyst at troika dialog  said:  i think a decision that yugansk should end up with gazprom was taken a long time ago, so the main question was how to structure this transaction,   i would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and gazprom now has a partner,  i would also not exclude that baikal will decline to pay in 14 days  that are given by law  and gazprom is then recognised as the winner, this would give gazprom an extra 14 days to accumulate the needed funds,  another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price,  however  gazprom has announced it is not linked to baikal in any way, and paul collison  chief analyst at brunswick ubs  said:  i see no plausible explanation for the theory that baikal was representing competing interests,  yugansk will most likely end up with gazprom but could still end up with the government, there is still potential for surprises,  yugansk is at the heart of yukos - pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day, the unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than $27bn in taxes and fines, yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant  and had sought refuge in us courts,  the us bankruptcy court s initial order on thursday - to temporarily block the sale - in response to yukos filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection  was upheld in a second ruling on saturday, the protection  if recognised by the russian authorities  would have allowed yukos  current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets, yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder  mikhail khodorkovsky, mr khodorkovsky is now in jail  on separate fraud charges, but president vladimir putin has described the affair as a crackdown on corruption - and the bbc s sarah rainsford in moscow says most russians believe the destruction of yukos is now inevitable, hours before the auction lawyers for menatep  a group through which mr khodorkovsky and his associates control yukos  said they would take legal action in other countries, menatep lawyers  who were excluded from observing the auction  said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound russian oil and gas exports,,,,,,,,,,,,,

turkey turns on the economic charm three years after a gruelling economic crisis  turkey has dressed its economy to impress,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   the cake will be bigger for everybody   said deputy prime minister abdullatif sener earlier this month,  turkey will not be a burden for the eu budget,  if admitted into the eu  turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros ($8bn; ¬£6bn) to its budget by 2014  according to a recent impact study by the country s state planning organisation, as turkey s gross domestic output (gdp) is set to grow by 6% per year on average  its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020, turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in  old europe  once its population comes of age, by 2014  one in four turks - or about 18 million people - will be aged 14 or less,  a literate and qualified turkish population   insisted mr sener   will make a positive impact on the eu,   this runs contrary to the popular view that turkey is getting ready to dig deep into eu taxpayers  wallets, however  turkey s assertions are confirmed by brussels  own impact studies  which indeed say that turkish membership would be good news for the eu economy, but only over time, costs are projected to be vast during the early years of turkey s membership  with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16,5bn euros and  according to some predictions  balloon to 33,5bn euros, this would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid  though such payments should decline as the country s farm sector  which currently employs one in three turks  would employ just one in five by 2020,  such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by turkey s government would never be delivered  say those who feel the turkish project should be shunned,  some fear that rather than providing an educated  sophisticated labour force for europe at large  the people who will leave turkey to seek work abroad will be poor  uneducated - and plentiful, more recently  less palatable concerns - at least in liberal european circles - have been voiced  with senior eu or member state officials talking darkly of a  river of islam   an  oriental  culture and a threat to europe s  cultural richness , of course  many opponents are politically motivated - their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the country s muslim traditions to well-documented concerns about the government s human rights record, yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand,  critics insist that much of the optimism about turkey s economic roadmap has been over-egged - an argument amplified by a 134% rise in the country s current account deficit to $10,7bn during the first 10 months of this year,  the country s massive debt - which includes $23bn owed to the imf and billions borrowed via the international bond markets - also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the eu,  in the new member states of the european union  gross public debt is typically about 40% of gross domestic product   says reza moghadam  assistant director of the imf s european department,  at about 80% of gdp  turkey s gross debt is double that figure,  turkey s debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country s devastating recession,  there is no question that although turkey is doing much better than in the past  it remains quite vulnerable   says michael deppler  director of the imf s european department,  its debt is far too high for an emerging economy,  a key factor for eu decision makers should be whether or not turkey has met its economic criteria, but economics is not a science, and although the state of turkey s economy is important  as is its pace of reform  the final decision on 17 december will be taken by politicians who will  of course  be guided by their political instincts,,,,,,,,
