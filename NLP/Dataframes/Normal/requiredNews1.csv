The pressure to have high-performing students is the bane of every teacher's existence and research shows that too much time off from the school routine can actually undo the hard work teachers put in to their students.,1

"The bureaucrats charged with implementing the Common Core dodge the flak from right and left, pointing out that the Common Core is a set of common standards, not a prescribed curriculum.   This defense, while limitedly accurate, is irrelevant. The problem with the Common Core is that it drives bad education.",1

"Ah! The wonderful sound of clanging medals, young voices cheering, and the slapping of high fives -- it's the sound of students being rewarded for collaborating and utilizing their STEM skills.

"They never tell you in teacher school, and it's rarely discussed elsewhere. It is never, ever portrayed in movies and tv shows about teaching. Teachers rarely bring it up around non-teachers for fear it will make us look weak or inadequate.",1
"I would not have been able to sustain and increase my interest for learning and thinking had I been only concentrating on the end result. The ""process"" and the ""enjoyment of  the process"" is the key to success.",1
"In my college classroom I often ask students about their technology habits and, to my surprise, I repeatedly find that this ""tech generation"" is not as active as we have come to believe.",1

"If you do not object to another remake of ET with cell phones added and the sets updated, this film is for you.  The audience was made up of children who all applauded at the end so there appeared to be no objection to this similarity.  The acting is so fine that the evening spent watching Earth to Echo will be enjoyable for all ages.",1
"PhD graduates come in different shapes and sizes; those passionate about an academic career, and those that are not. As it becomes clear that an academic career is not the ultimate goal - panic, dread and feelings of lack of accomplishment may start to reign.",1

,1
Judge Treu's opinion unfortunately reflects a misunderstanding of education research and teacher employment law's effects. His decision also erodes labor protections without increasing the likelihood of an excellent education for students in low-income communities.,1

,1
"Someday, maybe 12 years from now, they think, all children will be college-ready, even if they live in squalor or have no home, even if they attend overcrowded classes with inexperienced teachers. Are they gullible? Or do they believe the public can be easily deceived?",1

Board of Education decision that ended the legal basis for separate but equal schooling, some public schools in the United States have gleaming labs, libraries and laptops while others lack textbooks, toilet paper and teachers certified in their subjects?",1

The impact that technology has had on our children because they are now always connected is that they now have become very disconnected with each other.,1
